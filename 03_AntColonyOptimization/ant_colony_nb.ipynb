    "This Jupyter Notebook deals with Ant-Colony-Optimization. All information is taken from Daniel Merkle's and Martin Middendorf's Chapter 14 on Swarm Intelligence in Search Methodologies. Introductory Tutorials in Optimization and Decision Support Techniques by Edmund K. Burke and Graham Kendall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ant-Colony Optimization is one of two main areas of Swarm Intelligence. It is used to solve optimization and search problems. The idea is that ant colonies find the shortest way form their nest to the food source with the help of pheromones. Experiments have shown that if you connect the nest with two different branches to a food source - one way is longer than the other one, ants will quickly find out which way is the shortest one. The result is an ant trail.\n",
    "\n",
    "How exactly does it work? At the beginning both branches are taken with the same probability. After a while the pheromone concentration will be higher at the shorter branch since the ants are back at the nest way faster if they have taken the short road. The pheromone concentration gets higher more easily and since ants are taking the road with a higher pheromone concentration, eventually \"all\" ants end up taking the short road."
